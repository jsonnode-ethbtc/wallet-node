# WalletConnect NodeServer ‚èÆÔ∏èüñ•Ô∏è‚è≠Ô∏è

Node Server for relaying WalletConnect connections

## Development üß™

Bitcoin Implementation in C#
Stratis is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol in C# on the .NET Core platform.
The node can run on the Bitcoin and Stratis networks.
Stratis Bitcoin is based on the NBitcoin project.

For Proof of Stake support on the Stratis token the node is using NStratis which is a POS implementation of NBitcoin.

.NET Core is an open source cross platform framework and enables the development of applications and services on Windows, macOS and Linux.

The design
A Modular Approach

A Blockchain is made of many components, from a FullNode that validates blocks to a Simple Wallet that track addresses. The end goal is to develop a set of Nuget packages from which an implementer can cherry pick what he needs.


  var node = new FullNodeBuilder()
   .UseNodeSettings(nodeSettings)
   .UseConsensus()
   .UseBlockStore()
   .UseMempool()
   .AddMining()
   .AddRPC()
   .Build();

  node.Run();
What's Next
We plan to add many more features on top of the Stratis Bitcoin blockchain: Sidechains, Private/Permissioned blockchain, Compiled Smart Contracts, NTumbleBit/Breeze wallet and more...

Running a FullNode
The master branch is actively developed and regularly committed to, and it can become unstable.
To compile a stable (production) release use any of the release tags form version 3.0.x.x and upwards.

dotnet build

To run on the Bitcoin network:

cd Stratis.BitcoinD
dotnet run
To run on the Stratis network:

cd Stratis.StratisD
dotnet run

## Production üóúÔ∏è

#### Setting up docker üéöÔ∏è

Dependencies:
- git
- docker
- make

You will need to have docker swarm enabled:

```bash
docker swarm init
# If you get the following error: `could not chose an IP address to advertise...`. You can do the following:
docker swarm init --advertise-addr `curl -s ipecho.net/plain`
```

### Deploying üöÄ

Run the following command and fill in the prompts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WalletConnect/node-walletconnect-bridge
cd node-walletconnect-bridge
make deploy
Bridge URL domain: <your bridge domain>
Email for SSL certificate (default noreply@gmail.com):
```


### Upgrading ‚è´

This will upgrade your current bridge with minimal downtime. 

‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION: This will run `git fetch && git merge origin/master` in your repo ‚ö†Ô∏è

```bash
make upgrade
```

### Monitoring üìú

This stack deploys 3 containers one of redis, nginx and node.js. You can follow the logs of the nginx container by running the following command:

```
docker service logs --raw -f walletconnect_nginx
```
